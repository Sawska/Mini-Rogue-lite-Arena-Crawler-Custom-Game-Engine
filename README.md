# 🕹️ Mini-Rogue-lite-Arena-Crawler — Custom 2D Game Engine

This project is the **capstone portfolio piece** for my freelance C++ developer profile. The objective is to build both a **custom 2D game engine** and a complete **rogue-lite arena crawler** from the ground up using modern C++ practices and powerful graphics libraries.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

A fast-paced, replayable **2D rogue-lite dungeon crawler** where players battle through procedurally generated arenas, level up through an expansive skill tree, and face off against a variety of bosses.

### Core Gameplay Loop:

* Enter procedurally generated dungeons
* Battle waves of enemies with responsive melee and ranged combat
* Earn loot, upgrade skills, and prepare for boss fights
* Defeat unique bosses to unlock new zones and abilities

## 🧠 Key Features (Planned)

### 🧪 Gameplay

* [ ] One playable hero with unique abilities and skill progression
* [ ] Procedurally generated levels with increasing difficulty
* [ ] Expansive **branching skill tree** with passive and active abilities
* [ ] 2–3 distinct dungeon zones, each with **2–4 unique boss variants**
* [ ] Loot system with randomized item drops and equipment
* [ ] Responsive combat: **melee**, **ranged**, and **projectile mechanics**
* [ ] Inventory system and basic crafting/upgrading
* [ ] Save/load system for persistent progression
* [ ] Polished UI with health bars, menus, inventory, and skill tree views

### 🧩 Engine Architecture

* [ ] Modular **ECS (Entity-Component-System)** architecture
* [ ] Custom **OpenGL-based 2D renderer**
* [ ] Scene management and level loading system
* [ ] Input abstraction layer (keyboard, mouse, controller)
* [ ] Resource manager (textures, audio, config files)
* [ ] Audio engine with sound effects and background music
* [ ] Basic 2D physics (AABB collision, velocity, movement)
* [ ] Optional: lightweight scripting support via Lua or internal DSL
